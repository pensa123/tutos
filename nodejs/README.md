# The main purposse of this is to get the NODE JS certification

The content of this guide was retreade from this [course](https://trainingportal.linuxfoundation.org/learn/course/nodejs-application-development-lfw211) to get the NODE JS certification 

## How to start 

The best way to install and use nodejs, is with a version control like NVM 
once you have nvm installed, in this course they are usign npm 20.*.* so you have to run `nvm install 20` and then use `nvm use 20` if you are not using other version of node you can set it as default 

## NodeJS commands 

### node -i v 

it gets the 

### node --help 

This is used to get help in nodejs 

### node --v8-options

This get specifics options for the version of node

### node --stack-trace-limit

This could be used to increese the trace limit when an error occur it have to be used like 
  `node --stack-trace-limit=99999 app.js`

### node --print o node -p

This execute an action and print the result 
Exmaple: 
  `node -p "2+2"` it returns an 4 
  `node -p "console.log(2+2)" ` it return undefined and print a 4 

### node --eval or node -e

This only execute an action 
Examples:
  `node -e "4+4"` it do nothing
  `node -e "console.log(2+2)" ` it only print a 4

### node -r file.js

It pre-charge a file 

Given two files preload.js and app.js

Preload.js

		console.log('preload.js: this is preloaded')

And a file called app.js containing the following:

		console.log('app.js: this is the main file')

The following command would print preload.js: this is preloaded followed by app.js: this is the main file:

`node -r ./preload.js app.js`

			preload.js: this is preloaded
			app.js: this is the main file

## Debugging tools

For debugging tools there are two commands, node --inspect and also no --inspect-bkr 
with both it create an url to watch that but the easier way is open google-chrome browser and search  `chrome://inspect/#devices` [This url](chrome://inspect/#devices)

and with bouth we can use debugger on the js file to debug that specific part, without adding the breakpoint on the browser 

### node --inspect app.js

It helps to inspect the code and watch the process but doesn't allow breakpoints

### node --inspect-bkr app.js

It helps to inspect the code and watch the process but it allows breakpoints



## Types 

On javascript there are many types like 

- Null: null
- Undefined: undefined
- Number: 1, 1.5, -1, NaN
- String: "string", 'string', \`string \`
- Boolean: true | false


## Functions

In javascript a function is also a value, and can be assign and use as others values 

```
function factory () {
  return function doSomething () {}
}
```

A funtion can be passed as a parameter 

`setTimeout(function () { console.log('hello from the future') }, 100)`

A function can be assigned to an object:

```
const obj = { id: 999, fn: function () { console.log(this.id) } }
obj.fn() // prints 999
```

It's crucial to understand that this refers to the object on which the function was called, not the object which the function was assigned to:

```
const obj = { id: 999, fn: function () { console.log(this.id) } }
const obj2 = { id: 2, fn: obj.fn }
obj2.fn() // prints 2
obj.fn() // prints 999
```

While normal functions have a prototype property (which will be discussed in detail shortly), fat arrow functions do not:

```
function normalFunction () { }
const fatArrowFunction = () => {}
console.log(typeof normalFunction.prototype) // prints 'object'
console.log(typeof fatArrowFunction.prototype) // prints 'undefined'
```

# Prototype inherit funtional 

There are many approaches and variations to creating a prototype chain in JavaScript but we will explore three common approaches: 

- functional
- constructor functions
- class-syntax constructors.

```
const wolf = {
  howl: function () { console.log(this.name + ': awoooooooo') }
}

const dog = Object.create(wolf, {
  woof: { value: function() { console.log(this.name + ': woof') } }
})

const rufus = Object.create(dog, {
  name: {value: 'Rufus the dog'}
})

rufus.woof() // prints "Rufus the dog: woof"
rufus.howl() // prints "Rufus the dog: awoooooooo"

console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(rufus) === dog) //true
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(dog) === wolf) //true
```

- the prototype of `rufus` is `dog`
- the prototype of `dog` is `wolf`
- the prototype of `wolf` is `Object.prototype`



```
class Wolf {
  constructor (name) {
    this.name = name
  }
  howl () { console.log(this.name + ': awoooooooo') }
}

class Dog extends Wolf {
  constructor(name) {
    super(name + ' the dog')
  }
  woof () { console.log(this.name + ': woof') }
}

const rufus = new Dog('Rufus')

rufus.woof() // prints "Rufus the dog: woof"
rufus.howl() // prints "Rufus the dog: awoooooooo"

// This will setup the same prototype chain as in the Functional Prototypal Inheritance and the Function Constructors Prototypal Inheritance examples:

console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(rufus) === Dog.prototype) //true
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(Dog.prototype) === Wolf.prototype) //true
```


```
class Wolf {
  constructor (name) {
    this.name = name
  }
  howl () { console.log(this.name + ': awoooooooo') }
}

// This is desugared to:

function Wolf (name) {
  this.name = name
}

Wolf.prototype.howl = function () {
 console.log(this.name + ': awoooooooo')
}

```
